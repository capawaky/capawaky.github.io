<h2>Hello World!</h2>

<p class="intro">My name is Carlos Kynäslahti. I live in Vantaa, Finland. I take photographs, write in fluent Finnish and English, occasionally film and edit videos. Sometimes I get to design and build things (like this website).</p>
<p>For fun I go to the gym three times a week, take Japanese lessons and occasionally play League of Legends. I also love American stand up comedy and podcasts.</p>

<p>I'm currently seeking employment in digital marketing. If you see what you like, don't hesitate to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:capawaky@gmail.com"> capawaky@gmail.com</a>
<p>I've studied at Metropolia UAS and graduated from the University of Hull, England (BA Business, MSc Website Design & Development).</p>
<p>PS. if you wonder what "capawaky" stands for, it's an acronym of my full name <span class="bold">CA</span>rlos <span class="bold">PA</span>ul <span class="bold">WA</span>ltter <span class="bold">KY</span>näslahti. Clever, right? </p>
