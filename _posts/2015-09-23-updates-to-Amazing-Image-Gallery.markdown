The [Amazing Image Gallery][AIG] [(GitHub repo)][AIGGitHub] nears its completion! It now happily fetches and displays up to 20 of the latest photos from my Instagram feed. I added <del>arrow-buttons</del> <ins class="bold">navigation</ins> to scroll through the feed, one image at a time. Mouseover now provides a tooltip box (credit goes to [Alessio Atzeni][Alessio]) with the photo's Instagram description. I'm not sure how much more features I will add to this project but it still needs a bit of bug fixing.
