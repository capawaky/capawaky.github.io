It's ALIVE! For the past few weeks, I've been working on my JavaScript (jQuery) [Amazing Image Gallery][AIG], which displays four thumbnails and one single main photo. The basic functionality for local images was completed sometime ago, but today I released the Instagram version of my gallery. It fetches the four most recent photographs from [my Instagram][instagram_carlospwk] feed and displays them in the gallery. Developing AIG took a lot of trial and error, googling, green tea and help from my instructor, but it was absolutely worth it. Next, I plan on adding thumbnail scrolling and image preloading to the gallery. 

I've also been busy figuring out git and [GitHub][GitHub_capawaky]. I decided from the get go to learn command line git instead of using the GitHub desktop app. Not just because using the command line is infinitely cooler than using a desktop, but because I felt that I'd learn more doing things manually. I'm still struggling a bit with the workflow and have to google a lot of things, but I'm getting better.
