Back in 2011 when I was studying at the School of Arts and New Media [(Scarborough, UoH)][SANM], one of my module assignments was to redesign the website for the Bradford Color Museum. The now [defunct website][ColorMuseum] was a wonderful array of questionable usability and design choices. Granted the website was very old and designed to serve as an "online experience" of sorts.

I no longer have the assignment brief but I remember concentrating on re-structuring the content of the original website to three entities: website, YouTube and Wiki. The original website had a lot of information about different fabric dyeing processes so instead of making a complex library for the website, I created a separate Wiki. Wikis are great for small non-commercial hobbyist communities for organising knowledge.

I started a YouTube account for the Color Museum to in a way replace the "[multimedia][CMMultimedia]" aspect of the website. Making videos is a relatively easy and cost effective way to add promotable content to your website and is very user friendly.

It was my first time creating a website mockup with Illustrator. For the main theme I picked a rainbow like palette of colors to display in the background. I restructured the information on the original site under appropriate headers and pages. The mockups are a little unpolished but them being my first website redesign project, I'm happy with how they turned out.
